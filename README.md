# multiple-choice-examination

The multiple-choice examination consists of 5 questions. Each question has four choices, labeled A, B, C, D. All data for that exam is stored in a txt file. A JavaFx application will randomly pick 5 questions from the txt file. 

A student’s final score is calculated by adding up the points awarded for all the questions. Points for a question are awarded as follows: 
• Correct answer 20 points
• Wrong answer -5 point 
• No answer 0 points

There will be a submit button to submit the result which will be stored in another txt file, a calculate button to calculate the current round points and the average points of all rounds from the beginning.
